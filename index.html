        <h3>What is blood Bank?</h3>
        <p>A blood bank is a center where blood gathered as a result of blood donation is stored and preserved
           for later use in blood transfusion.
        </p>
        <p><span class="highlight">Today, blood banks</span> collect blood and separate it into its various components so they can be used most
           effectively according to the needs of the patient. Red blood cells carry oxygen, platelets help the
           blood clot, and plasma has specific proteins that allow proper regulation of coagulation and healing.
           where proper   testing   is   performed   to   reduce   the   risk   of   transfusion   related   events.
        </p>
        <p> Before the blood is supplied to  the  patients,  the  blood  will  undergo  several  tests  to  ensure
            that  the  blood  receiver  is  not  infected  by  serious  diseases. There are a few units operating
            in this department such as Blood House Unit, Blood Transfusion Unit, and Blood Distribution Unit.
        </p>

        <h3>Why its DATA must be managed?</h3>
        <p>The  process  of  managing  the  blood  bag  that  is  received  from  the  blood  donation  events  needs
            a  proper  and  systematic  management. The blood bag must be handled with care and treated thoroughly as
            it is related to someoneâ€™s life.
            A single mistake can lead to very serious issues(even death).
        </p>
        <p>The  percentage  of  people  donating  blood  is  increasing  day  by  day  due  to  awareness  to  donate
            blood  for  those  needed.  The  blood  received  have  to  be  managed  thoroughly  so  that  there
            will  be  no  negative  effect  to  the  blood  receiver once they received blood.
        </p>
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>As Blood donation is increasing day by day.</li>
          <li>Information of donor and his blood are data.</li>
          <li>thies data must be stored somewhere for future use.</li>
          <li>storing the data manually is hard and dificult to maintain.</li>
          <li>searching updating deleting every thing was written stuff, which is very hard and problem to maintain.</li>
          <li>so,to solve this problem we introduse RDBMS</li>
          <li>which is very iffecient in insert updating searching stuff.</li>
          <li>lot and lot time is saved with security and back up protection.</li>
          <li>so we are try to build a RBDMS managment system for blood bank!</li>

        <p>DBMS  is  a  management  system  that  is  developed  to  manage  blood  bank.</p>
        <p>This  is  to  make  sure  that  the  management  of  the  blood  stock  became effective, systematic and meeting end user requirements.</p>
        <p> The functional services provided in the current version are  <span class="highlight">profile  management</span>,  <span class="highlight">blood  stock  management</span></p>
        <p> In  the  next  phase  we  will  develop a <span class="highlight"> blood  analysis  managemen</span></p>
